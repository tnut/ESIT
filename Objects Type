This is the list of object type that ESIT have to communicate with.

==================================================
* THIS ARE NOT PHYSICAL OBJECTS, SIGNALS OR PUMP *
==================================================

The interface between theses OBJECTS TYPE is done in AC 800 M PLC (and not in the 800xA system)

It means the relationship is defined as:

	1 NAME + 1 NODE NUMBER ( PLC Nr) + 1 OBJECTYPE + 1 RULE = 1 information (1 variable ) in the PLC
	Each information (variable) will be available on the Communication BUS.
	It also means that each information will have a FIXED defined UID, address, index or register value in the PLC
	Each of this variable are then available in the PLC and can be modified by the PLC Programm AND by ESIT when apply.

TEXT (TBD)



- TYPE BOOL can only be TRUE or FALSE.
	BOOL RESULT OPERATORS: AND, OR, XOR, NOT
	ANALOG (INT) RESULT OPERATORS: +, -

- TYPE ANALOG are Float values when not specify.
	ANALOG RESULT OPERATORS: +, -, *, /, %, MAX, MIN
	BOOL RESULT OPERATORS: ==, >, <
	As the result is a BOOL: !=, =>, <= can be combined with the BOOL NOT operator

- Read Only rules can ONLY be used in the conditions and may be the right VALUE of an ASSIGNEMT in the command
	==> VALUE CHANGES on them in COMMANDS are NOT ALLOW !!!
	==> BUT they are Read/Write access by the ESIT "engine" as explain in "Order of rules execution"

- Read/Write rules can be used in BOTH conditions and commands.

- a COMMAND is ALWAYS an Assignment like:
	F20AA01 open = TRUE
	F20AP01 start  = STEP RUN (5.1.1.7 STEP RUN is a READONLY rule)

- a CONDITION is ALWAYS a BOOL RESULT OPERATOR

- Order of rules execution:

	5.2.1.5/Next Active Step Number = Next step in the editor
	5.2.1.1/Active Step Number = Current step in the editor
	5.1.1.7/STEP RUN = TRUE

	COMMAND 1 = STEP RUN
	COMMAND 2 = TRUE
        COMMAND n = TRUE

	CONDITION 1
	CONDITION 2
	CONDITION n

	When the Cycle Time is elapsed:
	5.2.1.2/Current Step Time = 5.2.1.2/Current Step Time + 5.2.1.7/cycle time  

	If NO CONDITIONS ARE SPECIFY OR
	all CONDITIONS are TRUE then
	START the Transition execution else repeat the cycle.
	

- Transition executions:

	5.2.1.4/Previous Active Step Number = 5.2.1.1/Active Step Number
	5.2.1.2/Current Step TIME = 0
	5.1.1.7/STEP RUN  = FALSE

	Execute again all the COMMANDS

	go to the STEPTO or NEXT STEP specified in the editor WITHOUT waiting the cycle time elapse

- Jump execution:
	TBD

- Step To execution:
	TBD
